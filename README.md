# Git-Documentation-Website
This is part of my certification for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course. I was tasked with creating a documentation webpage with a specified layout and element requirements.

## Future Improvements:
- Make the page more responsive for different layouts
- Get the section in the nav bar to stay highlighted when you are reading in that section
